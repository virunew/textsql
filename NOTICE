NOTICE - Overview

LLMWare Models.  This software contains links to the LLMWare public model repository currently hosted on Huggingface (www.huggingface.co/llmware).  LLMWare models in this repository are generally licensed under a separate Apache License 2.0 license, e.g., https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.  Where there are any exceptions to Apache 2.0, it is noted on the Model Card, e.g., Llama 2 Community License or CC-BY-SA-4.0, and is following licensing conditions of the underlying base models.   All of the LLMWare models that are listed in the ModelCatalog in this repository are permissively licensed and may be used for commercial purposes in conjunction with llmware, subject to the license terms found with the model cards.

3rd Party Models.  The llmware software package also provides the ability to use other 3rd party models in conjunction with the llmware software.  Use of any third party models is subject to the licensing terms of those models.

Sample Testing Files.  This software includes sample files that are made available for testing, including documents and audio files.   These files have either been derived from open public domain sources, or produced as original materials by the llmware team to be used as test samples and  examples.  These files are made available solely for purposes of testing and illustrating the use of key llmware functions, and should not be used, distributed or published in any other manner.   The audio files, in particular, may be subject to copyright protections that preclude any other form of publishing beyond limited 'fair use' as testing files.

Compiled Enabling Components.  This software consists primarily of Python source code, but also includes back-end enabling components consisting of prebuilt compiled C/C++ shared libraries and supporting 3rd party dependencies:

    * libpdf_llmware - this is a PDF parser written in C developed and copyrighted separately by llmware, which implements the ISO-32000 specification.  The compiled parser is provided as a shared library as part of the llmware software package, under an Apache 2.0 license, but the source code has not been provided in the llmware project currently.  The interfaces to the shared library are in the Python source code in the Parser module, which enable the user to access, configure and control the behavior of the PDF parser as part of building applications and other solutions with llmware.
    
    * liboffice_llmware - this is an Office XML parser written in C developed and copyrighted by llmware, which implements the ISO-29500 Office Open XML specification for documents that conform with Word, Powerpoint and Excel formats.   The compiled parser is provided as a shared library as part of the llmware software package, under an Apache 2.0 license, but the source code has not been provided in the llmware project currently.  The interfaces to the shared library are in the Python source code in the Parser module, which enable the user to access, configure and control the behavior of the Office parser as part of building applications and other solutions with llmware.
    
    * libgraph_llmware - this module provides a set of NLP-based utility functions, written in C developed and copyrighted by llmware, and exposed in the Python code in the graph module.   The compiled code is provided as a shared library as part of the llmware software package, under an Apache 2.0 license, but the source code has not been released in the llmware project currently.
    
    * llama.cpp / GGUF - this a prebuilt shared library implementation of Llama.CPP and associated GGML middleware components, licensed under a MIT license with the source code and all other information in the repository:  www.github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp.git.  The llmware implementation generally follows the core Python interface for Llama.CPP as provided in the repository:  www.github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python.git, although there will be differences from time-to-time, and llmware may have additional features not found in other Python interfaces and vice versa.   The llmware shared library implementation is regularly updated and re-compiled, and tested for integration into llmware, but may depart from the current source code of llama.cpp.
    
    * whisper.cpp / GGML - this is a prebuilt shared library implementation of Whisper.CPP and associated GGML middleware components, licensed under a MIT license with the source code and all other information in the repository:  www.github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp.git.   The llmware Python interface for Whisper.CPP was developed originally, but took inspiration from www.github.com/carloscdias/whisper-cpp-python.git, which is provided under a MIT license.  The llmware shared library implementation is regularly updated and recompiled, and tested for integration into llmware, but may depart from the current source code of whisper.cpp.

    Why shared libraries rather than source code?  The objective of including these prebuilt shared libraries in this project is to enable a complete LLM-based pipeline development framework that works "out of the box" on multiple platforms, and also enables a developer to rapidly and intuitively scale to large, complex solutions.   We view these shared libraries as enabling components with the core of the llmware project consisting of the higher-level classes and functions exposed in the Python source code.  In the future, we may revisit the decision to publish the source code for the llmware parsers (e.g., libpdf_llmware, liboffice_llmware, libgraph_llmware), and/or provide under a separate project repository focused on lower-level components and in C/C++.   Generally, these parsers are complex, standalone, low-level code that implements the arcane rules of various ISO standards, and for the foreseeable future, we do not have the bandwidth to manage a full open source documentation, testing, and lifecycle around that source code base - without it overwhelming the main objective of llmware.

Vector Databases.  This software provides integration to a wide variety of vector database resources, using the open source Python drivers and associated SDKs provided by the vector database vendor with the licensing details outlined below.  Users need to install any vector databases separately and independently, subject to the licensing terms from those vendors.  llmware does not provide any licenses to vector databases, and llmware does not require the use of a vector database for a wide range of use cases.  In several Fast Start examples, we demonstrate how to use "no-install" vector databases, such as FAISS (MIT license), ChromaDB (Apache 2.0 license - www.github.com/chroma-core/chroma.git) and LanceDB (Apache 2.0 license - www.github.com/lancedb/lancedb.git), but no license is provided to those separate resources.

General Purpose Databases.  This software provides integration to three core database resources - Postgres, MongoDB and SQLite.  llmware connects to these resources using open source Python and C drivers.  Users need to install these databases separately and indendently, subject to the licensing terms from those vendors.  llmware does not provide any licenses to databases, and llmware does not require the use of a database for a wide range of use cases.

Huggingface Integration.  This software provides features and functions that enable access to models, tokenizers and datasets hosted in Huggingface repositories and accessible via the Huggingface transformers, tokenizers, datasets and huggingface-hub libraries.  In providing interfaces to these resources, llmware uses transformers, in particular, which is provided by Huggingface under an Apache 2.0 license (see www.github.com/huggingface/transformers.git).  In addition, related to these interfaces, llmware provides code that was influenced, derived, and in a few limited cases, copied, from transformers source code to facilitate the integration.   Some of this transformers code, especially the underlying model class code, is subject to additional copyright notices from HuggingFace, Google AI, EleutherAI, NVIDIA and potentially others for specific models.  For use of any individual third party model, accessed through a Huggingface repository, we recommend reviewing the individual model card to confirm the licensing terms and other associated copyrights.

GNU Lesser General Public License - Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.
As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.

A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked Version”.

The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
4. Combined Works.
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
d) Do one of the following:
0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.
e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)
5. Combined Libraries.
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.
