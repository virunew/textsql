## üß∞üõ†Ô∏èüî©The Ultimate Toolkit for Enterprise RAG Pipelines with Small, Specialized Models   

From quickly building POCs to scalable LLM Apps for the enterprise, LLMWare is packed with all the tools you need. 

`llmware` is an integrated framework with over 50+ small, specialized, open source models for quickly developing LLM-based applications including Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Multi-Step Orchestration of Agent Workflows.  

This project provides a comprehensive set of tools that anyone can use - from a beginner to the most sophisticated AI developer - to rapidly build industrial-grade, knowledge-based enterprise LLM applications. 

Our specific focus is on making it easy to integrate open source small specialized models and connecting enterprise knowledge safely and securely. 


##  Getting Started 

1.  Install llmware - `pip3 install llmware`  


2.  Make sure that you are running on a [supported platform](https://www.github.com/llmware-ai/llmware/tree/main/docs/getting_started/platforms.md#platform-support).  


3.  Learn by example:  

    -- [Fast Start examples](https://www.github.com/llmware-ai/llmware/tree/main/fast_start) - structured set of 6 examples (with no DB installations required) to learn the main concepts of RAG with LLMWare - each example has extensive comments, and a supporting video on Youtube to walk you through it.    

    -- [Getting Started examples](https://www.github.com/llmware-ai/llmware/tree/main/examples/Getting_Started) - heavily-annotated examples that review many getting started elements - selecting a database, loading sample files, working with libraries, and how to use the Model Catalog.  

    -- [Use Case examples](https://www.github.com/llmware-ai/llmware/tree/main/examples/Use_Cases) - longer examples that integrate several components of LLMWare to provide a framework for a solution for common use case patterns.  

    -- Dive into specific area of interest - [Parsing](https://www.github.com/llmware-ai/llmware/tree/main/examples/Parsing) - [Models](https://www.github.com/llmware-ai/llmware/tree/main/examples/Models) - [Prompts](https://www.github.com/llmware-ai/llmware/tree/main/examples/Models) - [Agents](https://www.github.com/llmware-ai/llmware/tree/main/examples/SLIM-Agents)  - and many more ...


4.  We provide extensive [sample files](https://www.github.com/llmware-ai/tree/main/examples/Getting_Started/loading_sample_files.py) integrated into the examples, so you can copy-paste-run, and quickly validate that the installation is set up correctly, and to start seeing key classes and methods in action.  We would encourage you to start with the 'out of the box' example first, and then use the example as the launching point for inserting your documents, models, queries, and workflows.  


5.  Learn by watching: check out the [LLMWare Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@llmware).

# Install llmware 

___  
**Using Pip Install**  

- Installing llmware is easy:  `pip3 install llmware` 


- If you prefer, we also provide a set of recent wheels in the [wheel archives](https://www.github.com/llmware-ai/llmware/tree/main/wheel_archives) in this repository, which can be downloaded individually and used as follows:  

```bash
pip3 install llmware-0.2.12-py3-none-any.wheel
````  

- We generally keep the main branch of this repository current with all changes, but we only publish new wheels to PyPi approximately once per week

___
**Cloning the Repository**  

- If you prefer to clone the repository:  

```bash
git clone git@github.com:llmware-ai/llmware.git
```

- The llmware package is contained entirely in the /llmware folder path, so you should be able to drop this folder (with all of its contents) into a project tree, and use the llmware module essentially the same as a pip install.  

- Please ensure that you are capturing and updating the /llmware/lib folder, which includes required compiled shared libraries.  If you prefer, you can keep only those libs required for your OS platform.  

- After cloning the repo, we provide a short 'welcome to llmware' automation script, which can be used to install the projects requirements (from llmware/requirements.txt), install several optional dependencies that are commonly used in examples, copy several good 'getting started' examples into the root folder, and then run a 'welcome_example.py' script to get started using our models.  To use the "welcome to llmware" script:  

Windows:  
```bash
.\welcome_to_llmware_windows.sh
```

Mac/Linux:
```bash
sh ./welcome_to_llmware.sh
```
