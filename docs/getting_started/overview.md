## üß∞üõ†Ô∏èüî©Building Enterprise RAG Pipelines with Small, Specialized Models  

`llmware` provides a unified framework for building LLM-based applications (e.g, RAG, Agents), using small, specialized models that can be deployed privately, integrated with enterprise knowledge sources safely and securely, and cost-effectively tuned and adapted for any business process.  

 `llmware` has two main components:  
 
 1.  **RAG Pipeline** - integrated components for the full lifecycle of connecting knowledge sources to generative AI models; and 

 2.  **50+ small, specialized models** fine-tuned for key tasks in enterprise process automation, including fact-based question-answering, classification, summarization, and extraction.  

By bringing together both of these components, along with integrating leading open source models and underlying technologies, `llmware` offers a comprehensive set of tools to rapidly build knowledge-based enterprise LLM applications.  

Most of our examples can be run without a GPU server - get started right away on your laptop.   

## üéØ  Key features 
Writing code with`llmware` is based on a few main concepts:

<details>
<summary><b>Model Catalog</b>: Access all models the same way with easy lookup, regardless of underlying implementation. 
</summary>  


```python
#   150+ Models in Catalog with 50+ RAG-optimized BLING, DRAGON and Industry BERT models
#   Full support for GGUF, HuggingFace, Sentence Transformers and major API-based models
#   Easy to extend to add custom models - see examples

from llmware.models import ModelCatalog
from llmware.prompts import Prompt

#   all models accessed through the ModelCatalog
models = ModelCatalog().list_all_models()

#   to use any model in the ModelCatalog - "load_model" method and pass the model_name parameter
my_model = ModelCatalog().load_model("llmware/bling-phi-3-gguf")
output = my_model.inference("what is the future of AI?", add_context="Here is the article to read")

#   to integrate model into a Prompt
prompter = Prompt().load_model("llmware/bling-tiny-llama-v0")
response = prompter.prompt_main("what is the future of AI?", context="Insert Sources of information")
```

</details>  

<details>  
<summary><b>Library</b>:  ingest, organize and index a collection of knowledge at scale - Parse, Text Chunk and Embed. </summary>  

```python

from llmware.library import Library

#   to parse and text chunk a set of documents (pdf, pptx, docx, xlsx, txt, csv, md, json/jsonl, wav, png, jpg, html)  

#   step 1 - create a library, which is the 'knowledge-base container' construct
#          - libraries have both text collection (DB) resources, and file resources (e.g., llmware_data/accounts/{library_name})
#          - embeddings and queries are run against a library

lib = Library().create_new_library("my_library")

#    step 2 - add_files is the universal ingestion function - point it at a local file folder with mixed file types
#           - files will be routed by file extension to the correct parser, parsed, text chunked and indexed in text collection DB

lib.add_files("/folder/path/to/my/files")

#   to install an embedding on a library - pick an embedding model and vector_db
lib.install_new_embedding(embedding_model_name="mini-lm-sbert", vector_db="milvus", batch_size=500)

#   to add a second embedding to the same library (mix-and-match models + vector db)  
lib.install_new_embedding(embedding_model_name="industry-bert-sec", vector_db="chromadb", batch_size=100)

#   easy to create multiple libraries for different projects and groups

finance_lib = Library().create_new_library("finance_q4_2023")
finance_lib.add_files("/finance_folder/")

hr_lib = Library().create_new_library("hr_policies")
hr_lib.add_files("/hr_folder/")

#    pull library card with key metadata - documents, text chunks, images, tables, embedding record
lib_card = Library().get_library_card("my_library")

#   see all libraries
all_my_libs = Library().get_all_library_cards()

```
</details>  

<details> 
<summary><b>Query</b>: query libraries with mix of text, semantic, hybrid, metadata, and custom filters. </summary>

```python

from llmware.retrieval import Query
from llmware.library import Library

#   step 1 - load the previously created library 
lib = Library().load_library("my_library")

#   step 2 - create a query object and pass the library
q = Query(lib)

#    step 3 - run lots of different queries  (many other options in the examples)

#    basic text query
results1 = q.text_query("text query", result_count=20, exact_mode=False)

#    semantic query
results2 = q.semantic_query("semantic query", result_count=10)

#    combining a text query restricted to only certain documents in the library and "exact" match to the query
results3 = q.text_query_with_document_filter("new query", {"file_name": "selected file name"}, exact_mode=True)

#   to apply a specific embedding (if multiple on library), pass the names when creating the query object
q2 = Query(lib, embedding_model_name="mini_lm_sbert", vector_db="milvus")
results4 = q2.semantic_query("new semantic query")
```

</details>  

<details>
<summary><b>Prompt with Sources</b>: the easiest way to combine knowledge retrieval with a LLM inference. </summary>

```python

from llmware.prompts import Prompt
from llmware.retrieval import Query
from llmware.library import Library

#   build a prompt
prompter = Prompt().load_model("llmware/bling-tiny-llama-v0")

#   add a file -> file is parsed, text chunked, filtered by query, and then packaged as model-ready context,
#   including in batches, if needed, to fit the model context window

source = prompter.add_source_document("/folder/to/one/doc/", "filename", query="fast query")

#   attach query results (from a Query) into a Prompt
my_lib = Library().load_library("my_library")
results = Query(my_lib).query("my query")
source2 = prompter.add_source_query_results(results)

#   run a new query against a library and load directly into a prompt
source3 = prompter.add_source_new_query(my_lib, query="my new query", query_type="semantic", result_count=15)

#   to run inference with 'prompt with sources'
responses = prompter.prompt_with_source("my query")

#   to run fact-checks - post inference
fact_check = prompter.evidence_check_sources(responses)

#   to view source materials (batched 'model-ready' and attached to prompt)
source_materials = prompter.review_sources_summary()

#   to see the full prompt history
prompt_history = prompter.get_current_history()
