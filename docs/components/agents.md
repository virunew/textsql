Agents with Function Calls and SLIM Models ðŸ”¥ 

llmware has been designed to enable Agent and LLM-based function calls using small language models designed for local and private 
deployment and the ability to leverage open source models to conduct complex RAG and knowledge-based workflow automation.  

The key elements in llmware:  

 - **SLIM models** - 18 function-calling small language models, optimized for a specific extraction, classification, generation, or 
summarization activity, and generate python dictionaries and lists as output.  

- **LLMfx class** - enables a wide range of agent-based processes.  

Here is an example to get started: 

```python

from llmware.agents import LLMfx

text = ("Tesla stock fell 8% in premarket trading after reporting fourth-quarter revenue and profit that "
        "missed analystsâ€™ estimates. The electric vehicle company also warned that vehicle volume growth in "
        "2024 'may be notably lower' than last yearâ€™s growth rate. Automotive revenue, meanwhile, increased "
        "just 1% from a year earlier, partly because the EVs were selling for less than they had in the past. "
        "Tesla implemented steep price cuts in the second half of the year around the world. In a Wednesday "
        "presentation, the company warned investors that itâ€™s 'currently between two major growth waves.'")

#   create an agent using LLMfx class
agent = LLMfx()

#   load text to process
agent.load_work(text)

#   load 'models' as 'tools' to be used in analysis process
agent.load_tool("sentiment")
agent.load_tool("extract")
agent.load_tool("topics")
agent.load_tool("boolean")

#   run function calls using different tools
agent.sentiment()
agent.topics()
agent.extract(params=["company"])
agent.extract(params=["automotive revenue growth"])
agent.xsum()
agent.boolean(params=["is 2024 growth expected to be strong? (explain)"])

#   at end of processing, show the report that was automatically aggregated by key
report = agent.show_report()

#   displays a summary of the activity in the process
activity_summary = agent.activity_summary()

#   list of the responses gathered
for i, entries in enumerate(agent.response_list):
    print("update: response analysis: ", i, entries)

output = {"report": report, "activity_summary": activity_summary, "journal": agent.journal}  

```
