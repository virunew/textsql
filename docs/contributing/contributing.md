## GitHub workflow

We follow the [``fork-and-pull``](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) Git workflow.

1.  [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine with `git clone git@github.com:<yourname>/llmware.git`.
3. Create a branch with `git checkout -b my-topic-branch`.
4. Run the test suite by navigating to the tests/ folder and running ```./run-tests.py -s``` to ensure there are no failures
5. [Commit](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/committing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) changes to your own branch, then push to GitHub with `git push origin my-topic-branch`.
6. Submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) so that we can review your changes.

Remember to [synchronize your forked repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#keep-your-fork-synced) _before_ submitting proposed changes upstream. If you have an existing local repository, please update it before you start, to minimize the chance of merge conflicts.

```shell
git remote add upstream git@github.com:llmware-ai/llmware.git
git fetch upstream
git checkout upstream/main -b my-topic-branch
```
