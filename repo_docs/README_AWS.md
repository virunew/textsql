Getting Started: `llmware` AMI from the AWS Marketplace
===============

The llmware python package is pre-installed on the AMI.  Examples of how to use llmware can be found locally in ~/llmware/examples and can be run using "python3 [filename].py".

The llmware package is updated frequenty, so it is strongly recommended to update the version running on your AMI with the following commands. To install the latest llmware package from PyPi:
```
 pip install llmware --upgrade
```

To pull the latest code from the llmware repository and gain access to the latest examples:  

  ```bash
  cd ~/llmware
  git pull
 
  ```
Some examples require LLM API Keys. You can edit the example code to include your own, or 
update ```~/set-env.sh``` and run the following to get the environment variables loaded in your shell:

```
source ~/set-env.sh
```

If you have deployed on a NVIDIA GPU instance type (g5.x2large or g5.4xlarge are good and cost-effective options), then you'll need to run this additional script to update the AMI with the NVIDIA drivers and CUDA:

```
source <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llmware-ai/llmware/main/scripts/aws/update-ami-nvidia-gpu.sh)
```

_Note: You can expect a one-time delay of 60-90 seconds when running llmware on this instance for the first time. 
This is due to how EBS storage volumes get loaded on-demand from the AMI storage snapshot._

MongoDB & Milvus
================

By default, MongoDB and Milvus are running on the AMI. 

To stop (or start) MongoDB or Milvus:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl [stop|start] [mongodb|milvus]
```

To disable (or re-enable) MongoDB or Milvus starting on instance reboot:
  ```bash
sudo systemctl [disable|enable] [mongodb|milvus]
```


Using llmware
==============

### ðŸ”¥ Start coding - Quick Start For RAG ðŸ”¥ 
```python
# This example demonstrates Retrieval Augmented Retrieval (RAG) using the llmware package:
import os
from llmware.library import Library
from llmware.retrieval import Query
from llmware.prompts import Prompt
from llmware.setup import Setup

# Update this value with your own API Key, either by setting the env var or editing it directly here:
openai_api_key = os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]

# A self-contained end-to-end example of RAG
def end_to_end_rag():
    
    # Create a library called "Agreements", and load it with llmware sample files
    print (f"\n > Creating library 'Agreements'...")
    library = Library().create_new_library("Agreements")
    sample_files_path = Setup().load_sample_files()
    library.add_files(os.path.join(sample_files_path,"Agreements"))

    # Create vector embeddings for the library using the "industry-bert-contracts model and store them in Milvus
    print (f"\n > Generating vector embeddings using embedding model: 'industry-bert-contracts'...")
    library.install_new_embedding(embedding_model_name="industry-bert-contracts", vector_db="milvus")

    # Perform a semantic search against our library.  This will gather evidence to be used in the LLM prompt
    print (f"\n > Performing a semantic query...")
    os.environ["TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM"] = "false" # Avoid a HuggingFace tokenizer warning
    query_results = Query(library).semantic_query("Termination", result_count=20)

    # Create a new prompter using the GPT-4 and add the query_results captured above
    prompt_text = "Summarize the termination provisions"
    print (f"\n > Prompting LLM with '{prompt_text}'")
    prompter = Prompt().load_model("gpt-4", api_key=openai_api_key)
    sources = prompter.add_source_query_results(query_results)

    # Prompt the LLM with the sources and a query string
    responses = prompter.prompt_with_source(prompt_text, prompt_name="summarize_with_bullets")
    for response in responses:
        print ("\n > LLM response\n" + response["llm_response"])
    
    # Finally, generate a CSV report that can be shared
    print (f"\n > Generating CSV report...")
    report_data = prompter.send_to_human_for_review()
    print ("File: " + report_data["report_fp"] + "\n")

end_to_end_rag()
```

- Employment period ends on the first occurrence of either the 6th anniversary of the effective date or a company sale.
- Early termination possible as outlined in sections 3.1 through 3.4.
- Employer can terminate executive's employment under section 3.1 anytime without cause, with at least 30 days' prior written notice.
- If notice is given, the executive is allowed to seek other employment during the notice period.
