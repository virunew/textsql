# Security Policy  

## Using llmware securely  

Due to the open connectivity and wide potential use cases of llmware, it is possible to use llmware in conjunction with a wide range of potential models and data sources.  

**Models** - be careful with models that you use, especially if the model is unknown to you, or demonstrates any unusual behavior. 

**Data Sources** - Be careful with data sources that you bring into llmware, both for any malicious content that may be in the sources, as well as potential data privacy or copyright concerns.  

If you believe that you have identified a security issue in any of these 3rd party components, we would recommend that you contact the original source of that component.  In such cases, there is usually little that llmware can do to directly help, and we do not view such cases as security vulnerabilities of llmware, per se.  


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in llmware, or in a dependency of llmware, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate all reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

Please report security issues by sending an email to `security@aibloks.com`.

Do __not__ submit an issue ticket or pull request or otherwise publicly disclose the issue.

After receiving your email, we will assess respond as soon as possible and share what we plan to do.
