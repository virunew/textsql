""" Fast Start Example #8 - Agents

    This example shows how to build locally-running Agents deploying multiple small specialized function-calling
    models as tools with an integrated work management, process and journaling capability using the LLMfx class.

    This example shows a workflow receiving a customer transcript, and having an agent run through a series of
    analytical and classification steps.

    1.  Create an agent using the LLMfx class.
    2.  Load multiple specialized tools for the agent.
    3.  Execute a series of function-calls.
    4.  Generate a consolidated automatic dictionary report.
