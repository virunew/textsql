"""This example shows how to easily create multiple embeddings over the same library with llmware

    This recipe can be especially useful when trying to compare the effectiveness of a particular
    embedding model for a specific domain or library corpus and to run other comparative experiments
    without being 'locked-in' to a particular model.

    Note: the example uses four different embedding models:

        1.  mini-lm-sbert - a favorite small, fast Sentence Transformer included in the llmware model catalog by default
        2.  text-embedding-ada-002 - the popular OpenAI embedding model
        3.  industry-bert-sec - an industry fine-tuned embedding model, in the llmware model catalog
        4.  all-mpnet-base-v2 - one of the most popular Sentence Transformers (which we will register and add to the
            model catalog on the fly

        To use OpenAI Ada will require an Open API key - if you do not have one, feel free to comment out or
        select a different model.  Any Sentence Transformer or Huggingface embedding model can be used.
