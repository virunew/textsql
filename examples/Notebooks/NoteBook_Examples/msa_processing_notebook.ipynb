    "Imagine you were given a large contract and asked a really specific question about it: \"What is the notice for termination for convenience?\" It would be an ordeal to locate the answer for this in the contract.\n",

    "\n",
    "What we want here is to perform something known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This is the process by which we give a language model some external sources (such as a contract). The external sources are intended to enhance the model's context, giving it a more comprehensive understanding of a topic. The model should then give us more accurate responses to the questions we ask it on the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, a general purpose model like Chat-GPT might be able to answer questions about contracts with RAG, but we can do something better. We can use LLMWare's dragon-yi-6b-gguf model, which is RAG-finetuned for fact-based question-answering on complex business and legal documents."
